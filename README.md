# Android-Yara-Rules
This repository contains a collection of YARA rules designed to detect Android malware. These rules have been carefully curated from a wide range of sources across the deep, dark, and surface web. The goal of this project is to provide the security community with valuable tools to identify malicious Android applications and behaviors more effectively.

Android malware is constantly evolving, and keeping up with new threats can be a challenge. By sharing these YARA rules, I aim to help researchers, analysts, and security professionals quickly identify and analyze suspicious Android apps. The rules are categorized by different malware families and behaviors, making it easier to detect specific threats based on known patterns.

I believe that collaboration is key to improving our defenses against Android malware. If you have any YARA rules, techniques, or insights that could enhance this collection.

This repository is open to contributions, and Iâ€™d love to see more researchers and security enthusiasts add their findings.
